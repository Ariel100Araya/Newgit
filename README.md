# Newgit
## GitHub has never looked this nice
### This app is in Beta! If you have any issue open an issue or just email me at ariel@prettycoolwebsite.com. 

## Hi there!
Hi! My name is Ariel and this is Newgit (pronounced new git) if you find a better for this project, please let me know. 

![Welcome!](screenshots/s3.png)

## Here to get the app?
Press the releases tab on the right side and click on the latest!

## The idea
Basically GitHub Desktop is based on Electron and although it works with multiple platforms it looks a little odd with the new design language of macOS, like a relic of the past of the days of macOS Yosemite. 

It works by doing gh and git commands in your terminal. Using Swift's Process() method, it makes for a nice looking repository manager, and using SwiftUI's NavigationSplitView it looks great too!

## Get set up

![Welcome!](screenshots/s4.png)

This app has the following requirements 

macOS Tahoe 26.1
HomeBrew package manager (https://brew.sh)
GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com)

You can sign into GitHub CLI by typing in "gh auth login" into your terminal and following the steps. Afterwards you can launch Newgit and it should say Welcome.

## Contribute

Want to help me out? Make a Pull Request (preferibly using Newgit but any way you do it works fine!). If you need to contact me again just email me at ariel@prettycoolwebsite.com

## Building

You can download the Newgit source code by pressing the green button that says code, if you don't see it, consider seeing an eye doctor.

You can press the .xcodeproj in Xcode and change the signature to your own. That is all

## Terms

YOU ARE PROHIBITED USING THIS PROGRAM FOR ANYTHING EVIL. - thank u

but in all seriousness. I don't mind you using this program as long as you credit me if you use the code, this was not "vibe coded" other than using it to fix bugs, this was me actually taking my time and doing things. other than that feel free to use the code.

I would love to know if you use Newgit, either press that little star icon at the top or email me at ariel@prettycoolwebsite.com

Thanks! 
Ariel
